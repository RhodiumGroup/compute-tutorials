# Tutorials for [compute.rhg](https://compute.rhg.com) and [compute.impactlab](https://compute.impactlab.org)

Try these tutorials out [on binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RhodiumGroup/compute-tutorials/master) (some features, including access to `/gcs` buckets, will not work) or by cloning this repo to your compute.rhg or compute.impactlab machine:

`git clone https://github.com/RhodiumGroup/compute-tutorials.git`

Once it's cloned to your directory, you should be able to open any of these notebooks in jupyterlab.
